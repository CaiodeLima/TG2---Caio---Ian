## Abstract

This work proposes the development of an algorithm based on artificial intelligence for
monitoring forest fires in the territory of the Legal Amazon, as an aid tool for daily classifi-
cation of fire. The use of machine learning was chosen for being a proven effective method
in environmental protection projects, which allows fast recognition of new events based
on historical information. The work focuses on the classification of fires, and for this the
models are trained with a public database that does not provide real-time information, but
has the classification for several fires that occurred in recent years.

## Conclusion
The presented work aimed to develop a wildfire classification system for the Legal Amazon territory, through a time series artificial intelligence algorithm. Additionally, it was also developed with the purpose of eventually being integrated into the Censipam Fire Panel system.


The literature review indicated that, although this type of approach is not innovative in the field of remote sensing in general, it is innovative in the context of sensing within the Legal Amazon territory.
The developed algorithm is capable of pulling official data and supplementing it, as well as classifying it with a satisfactory accuracy rate.


For future work, there is the possibility of testing different neural network architectures for time series, such as other recurrent or convolutional networks. Additionally, it is expected to integrate the program into Censipam's official system as a classifier tool for its data, which could then be used by competent authorities in fighting forest fires.
