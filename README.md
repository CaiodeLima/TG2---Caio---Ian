## Abstract

This work proposes the development of an algorithm based on artificial intelligence for
monitoring forest fires in the territory of the Legal Amazon, as an aid tool for daily classifi-
cation of fire. The use of machine learning was chosen for being a proven effective method
in environmental protection projects, which allows fast recognition of new events based
on historical information. The work focuses on the classification of fires, and for this the
models are trained with a public database that does not provide real-time information, but
has the classification for several fires that occurred in recent years.
